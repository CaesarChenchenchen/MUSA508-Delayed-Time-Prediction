11.28 Problem 

1. The definition of big city have some problem (all city is big city)
   
perhaps we need to redefine the scale of the city based on the population distribution.

3. The dataset scale problem
   
if we just use one month dataset and we want to create a week lag, there will just late 3 weeks' data have lag, and when we try to split the train and test dataset, perhaps it will not be big enough.
